Agenda:

**Topic for discussion** | **Sub Topic** | **Notes** |
-- | -- | --
Online meetup reminders |Online etiquette |:sparkling_heart: Make sure you mute your mic when someone else is speaking<br>:sparkling_heart: Feel free to use the chat function if you need help or if you don't feel comfortable piping up<br>:sparkling_heart: if at any point you might want to share your screen to illustrate something you are doing, make sure all visible content is appropriate. |
Introductions and (reintroductions) | Amount shared totally optional |:sparkling_heart: Name and where you are from<br>:sparkling_heart: Anything Python you want to share â€“ also time for this later<br>:sparkling_heart: How did you feel about the snow this week?
Chapter concepts |`Interactive shell` |:sparkling_heart: Valuable skill that even experienced developers continue to use. |
Chapter concepts |`Errors` |:sparkling_heart: Women in particular tend to avoid making mistakes, but<br>:sparkling_heart: MISTAKES ARE MAGICAL! That's how we learn. |
Chapter concepts |`Assignment vs comparison` |:sparkling_heart: `=` is assignment, `==` is comparison<br>:sparkling_heart: To remember that `==` is comparison, think of it as the opposite of `!=`. |
Chapter concepts |`Standards` |:sparkling_heart: Many of the code style guidelines are defined in [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) |
Chapter concepts |`Code Comments` |:sparkling_heart: Ignored by program<br>:sparkling_heart: Useful for notes to self<br>:sparkling_heart: Useful when collaborating<br>:sparkling_heart: As you advance, work to replace the need for code comments by using variable (and function/method) names that clearly/succinctly explain what they are/do/contain.<br>:sparkling_heart: Different from use-case of function/class/module docstrings |
Chapter concepts |Extra credit!<br>Personal recommendations of favorite/useful built-in functions.<br>[Python built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) |:sparkling_heart: `max()` and other basic math built-ins are great for comparisons<br>:sparkling_heart: `tuple` is a data type, similar to a `list` but "immutable" (can't be edited unless overwritten) |
General discussion |`Standards or preferences` |Examples:<br>:sparkling_heart: mu vs other IDEs (VSCode, PyCharm, etc)<br>:arrow_up: this is a matter of preference/comfort/use-case<br>:sparkling_heart: `snake_case` vs `camelCase`<br>:arrow_up: standard laid out in [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (use snake_case for variable names in Python)<br>:sparkling_heart: `import random` vs `from random import randint` vs `from random import *`<br>:arrow_up: also laid out in [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (TL;DR: don't use the third method)|
Chapter concepts |`Flow control` |:sparkling_heart: "boolean logic" is used a TON in programming!<br>:sparkling_heart: Python does not have a "switch" statement (use `if/elif/else`) |
Other |PyCon 2020! |:sparkling_heart: PyCon 2020 is posting presentations online. See [us.pycon.org](https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/) for details. |
General discussion |Anything you want to share, suggestions, recommendations, etc. | |
Next meeting |Chapters 3-? |May, specifics TBD |
