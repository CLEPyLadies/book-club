## Chapter 5: Dictionaries & Structuring Data

**Chapter 5 heading** | **Notes** |
-- | --
The dictionary data type | :sparkling_heart:
Dictionaries vs Lists | :sparkling_heart:
The keys(), values(), and items() methods | :sparkling_heart:
Checking whether a key or value exists in a dictionary | :sparkling_heart:
The get() method | :sparkling_heart:
The setdefault() method | :sparkling_heart:
Pretty printing | :sparkling_heart:
Using data structures to model real-world things | :sparkling_heart:
A tic-tac-toe board | :sparkling_heart:
Nested dictionaries and lists | :sparkling_heart:

**Chapter 5 practice question** | **Solution/Notes** |
-- | -- 
What does the code for an empty dictionary look like? | `emptyDict = {}`<br>`emptyDict = dict()`
What does the dictionary with a key `'foo'` and a value `42` look like? | `dictA = {'foo': 42}`
What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list? | Dictionaries are unordered.<br>Dictionaries can have non-integer keys.
What happens if you try to access `spam['foo']` if `spam` is `{'bar': 100}`? | `KeyError`<br>Unless you<br>a) set a default value<br>b) try: `spam['foo']` except `KeyError`: whatever else you want to do<br>c) if 'foo' in `spam`: ...<br>d) if 'foo' in `spam.keys()`: ...<br>e) if `spam.get('foo')`: ...<br> You can also set a default value as you check for a key `spam.get('foo', 9)`
If a dictionary is stored in `spam`, what is the difference between the expressions `'cat' in spam` and `'cat' in spam.keys()`? | Trick question! There isn't one.
If a dictionary is stored in `spam`, what is the difference between the expressions `'cat' in spam` and `'cat' in spam.values()`? | `'cat' in spam.values()` returns the True/False of whether 'cat' is in the dictionary *values*, not the keys.
What module and function can be used to "pretty print" dictionary values? | `pprint`
What is a shortcut for the following code? | `spam.setdefault('color', 'black')`
```python
if 'color' not in spam:
    spam['color'] = 'black'
```

**Chapter 6 practice question** | **Solution/Notes** |
-- | -- 
What are escape characters? | Allows you to define characters in strings that Python would otherwise ignore or error on.<br>Examples: `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab, `\'` and `\"`
What do the `\n` and `\t` escape characters represent? | `\n` for newline, `\t` for tab
How can you put a `\` backslash character in a string? | `'\\'` or `"\\"`
The string value `"Howl's Moving Castle"` is a valid string. Why isn't it a problem that the single quote character in the word `Howl's` isn't escaped? | We used double-quotes to define our string boundaries
If you don't want to put `\n` in your string, how can you write a string with newlines in it? | Use triple quotes to define boundaries on a multi-line string! `"""You can hit enter as much as you like in a multi-line string and those newlines will be interpreted as such without needing a \n newline escape"""`
What do the following expressions evaluate to? | (see individual lines)
`'Hello, world!'[1]` | `e`
`'Hello, world!'[0:5]` | `Hello`
`'Hello, world!'[:5]` | `Hello`
`'Hello, world!'[3:]` | `lo, world!`
`'Hello'.upper()` | `HELLO`
`'Hello'.upper().isupper()` | `True`
`'Hello'.upper().lower()` | `hello`
`'Remember, remember, the fifth of November'.split()` | `['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'November']`
`'-'.join('There can only be one.'.split())` | `There-can-be-only-one.`
What string methods can you use to right-justify, left-justify, and center a string? | `.ljust()`, `.rjust()`, and `.center()`
How can you trim whitespace characters from the beginning or end of a string? | `.strip()`
