**Chapter 5 practice question** | **Solution/Notes** |
-- | -- 
What does the code for an empty dictionary look like? | `emptyDict = {}`<br>`emptyDict = dict()`
What does the dictionary with a key `'foo'` and a value `42` look like? | `dictA = {'foo': 42}`
What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list? | Dictionaries are unordered.<br>Dictionaries can have non-integer keys.
What happens if you try to access `spam['foo']` if `spam` is `{'bar': 100}`? | tbd
If a dictionary is stored in `spam`, what is the difference between the expressions `'cat' in spam` and `'cat' in spam.keys()`? | tbd
If a dictionary is stored in `spam`, what is the difference between the expressions `'cat' in spam` and `'cat' in spam.values()`? | tbd
What module and function can be used to "pretty print" dictionary values? | tbd
What is a shortcut for the following code? | tbd
```python
if 'color' not in spam:
