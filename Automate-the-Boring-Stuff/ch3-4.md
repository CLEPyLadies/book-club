Chapter concepts | 3 |:sparkling_heart: A function is like a miniprogram within a program <br> def statement: Defines what comes after as a function. <br>  The body of the function block fo text dictates what the function does. Code in the body of the function is executed when the function is called, not when it is defined.  <br> Purpose of function is to group code that gets executed multiple times --> use when code gets duplicated to ease changes and bug fixes  <br>:sparkling_heart: Key Concepts <br> define: to createa function using the def statement <br> call: typing the function so that it an be used <br> passing: the action of palcing the variable used as an argument in the parentheses of the function call; sometimes used as a synonym for calling a function <br> arguments: Values that are passed to the function by being typed between parantheses <br> parameters: Variables in the function that are assigned an argument. <br> return value: the result of calling a function, when creating a function the return value is specified by the key work return. <br> return statement:  Consists of the return keyword and the value or expression that the function should return. <br>  None:  Value that represents the absence of value, it is the only value in the NoneType data type and must be typed with a captial N. <> Keyword arguements: Most arguments are indicated by their position. Keyword arguments have the keyword before the argument in the function call and are often used for optional parameters. <br>  call stack:  How Python remembers wehre to return the execution after each function call. <br> frame object: stores the line number fo the original function call and puts it on top of the call stack.  If another function is called another frame object with that line number is then put on top of the call stack. <br> local scope/local variable: Occurs within the function. <br> global scope/global variable: occurs outside the function. <br> :sparkling_heart: Reasons global and local scope are important. <br> 1. Code in the global scope, outside of all functions, cannot use any local variables. <br> 2. Code in local scope can access global variables. <br> 3. Code in a function's local scope cannot use variables in any other scope. <br> 4. You can use the same name for different variables if they are in different scopes. <br> :sparkling_heart: Four rules to tell if a variable is in a global or local scope. <br> 1. If a variable is being used in the global scope it is a global variable.  <br> 2. If there is a global statement for that variable in a function it is a global variable. <br> Otherwise, if the variable is used in the assignment statement in a function, it is a local variable. <br> 4. But if it is not used in an assignment statement, it is a global variable <br> :sparkling_heart: Try and Except statements <br>  These are statement used to navigate through errors when iterating through loops and other areas where you do not want your code to break because of an error| 
Chapter concepts |4 |:sparkling_heart: list: A value that contains multple values in an ordered sequence <br> list value:  Refers to the list itself not the values inside the list values.  It can be used as a value and passed as an argumetn or stored as a variable.  Lists are indicated by a square bracket [] <br> items:  Values inside the list, they are separated by commas <br> index:  The number starting with 0 that indicates the location of an item in a list.  Items are refered to by the variable name followed by square brackes with the index inside. Example: Spam[0] <br> slice:  A way of isolating more than one index of a list.  A slice will not include the last index, but only indices up to that number. <br> You can change a variable in a list by indicating its index and declaring that variable.  Example: spam[0] = "aardvark" <br> You can concatenate lists with the + and replicated lists with * <br> del statement can be used to delete an item in a list. <br> Use lists when you have multiple, repetitive variables.  Commonly used when you need to write a loop because the code can access the index and value of that index <br> in/non in are used to determine if a value is in or not in the loop. <br>  :sparkling_heart: Key functions and methods <br> len() used to get the lenght of the list <br> enumerate() used for each iteration in the loop enumerate will return two values the index and the item <br> random.choice() from the random library, select an item at random form the list <br> random.shuffle() from the random library, reorder the items in a list <br> Methods are functions that are called on a value or variable.  Common methods are .index(), .append(), .insert(), .remove(), .sort(), and .reverse()<br> :sparkling_heart: Mutable objects are things that can be changed, immutable objects are things that cannot be changed.  <br> tuples are like lists except that they are immutable and created by being put in parentheses. <br> list() and tuple() are used to cast tuples and lists into each other <br> :sparkling_heart: References:  Variables actually store reference to computer memory locations where the values are stored, mutable variables change the reference location and immutable variables do not. <br>  id() is the function that returns the unique identity of the variable in the machine that is uses as the reference <br> automatic garbage collector: This is the part of Python that deletes any values not being refered to by any variables to free up memory <br> :sparkling_heart: copy.copy() creates a a copy of the list, from the copy library, copy.deepcopy() creates a copy of a list of lists and is also fromthe copy library |
